This is a beta version of HCSW's TI-83 onboard forth compiler/interpreter.

There are a few deficiencies that prevent it from being as useful as it could
be.

Requires TASM, m4, and bin8x to be installed if you want to compile.
You will probably need to edit tcompile to point to your tasm80.tab and ti83plus.inc files.

TODO:

* Make it a flash app
* Add support for loading from a "file"
* Replace the code in string.z80 with a more flexible routine (that can load from a file and so on)
* DOCUMENT THE CODE



Good luck with this code,
